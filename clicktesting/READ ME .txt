a.exe = comparing click latency between two mice, tells you the difference between RMB and LMB input

l.exe = measures duration of left clicks

r.exe = measures duration of right clicks

old lr.exe = measures duration of both clicks and time between both clicks, also takes other non-main buttons and scroll wheel

for all of these programs: click outside of the command prompt window otherwise they'll malfunction
